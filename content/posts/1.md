Now that we understand how transitions work, we can build off of those core concepts to create some nice CSS animations. We’ll still use the `<transition>` component, and we’ll still give it a name, allowing us to have the same class hooks. The difference here will be that instead of just setting the final state and saying how we want it to interpolate between beginning and end, we’ll use @keyframes in CSS to create fun and lovely effects.

In the last section, we talked a little about how you can designate a special name for the transition component that we can then use as class hooks. But in this section, we’ll go a step further, and apply different class hooks to different sections of the animation. You’ll recall that enter-active and leave-active is where all the juicy business of animating happens. We can set different properties on each of these class hooks, but we can go one step further and give special classes to each instance:

```html
<div id="app">
  <h3>Bounce the Ball!</h3>
  <button @click="toggleShow">
    <span v-if="isShowing">Get it gone!</span>
    <span v-else>Here we go!</span>
  </button>
  <transition
    name="ballmove"
    enter-active-class="bouncein"
    leave-active-class="rollout">
  <div v-if="isShowing">
    <app-child class="child"></app-child>
  </div>
  </transition>
</div>
```
