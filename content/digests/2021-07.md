description: В этом посте я рассказываю, как придумал новый термин Security Experience (SX) по аналогии с Developer Experience (DX). Таким образом я запаковал ряд вопросов, связанных с эффективностью работы подразделения кибербезопасности, в некую сущность, которой удобно оперировать в стратегическом планировании, делать метрики и т.д. Фактически речь идёт про удобство использования нормативки, различных тулов и процессов.

## Welcome to Issue 139!

As I’m reaching the forty-year mark later this week, these words by author and activist Alice Walker are cause for reflection:

> Some periods of our growth are so confusing that we don’t even recognise that growth is happening. We may feel hostile or angry or weepy and hysterical, or we may feel depressed. It would never occur to us, unless we stumbled on a book or a person who explained to us, that we were in fact in the process of change, of actually becoming larger, spiritually, than we were before.

Overall, the past decade has been wonderful to me. There are so many moments I can look back on with joy and contentment. But it was the difficult times that first challenged and eventually changed my default attitude towards a lot of things. Friendships, relationships, work, money, health, privilege, consumption, ownership – the way I assign meaning and priority to all those things is vastly different now than it was just a few years ago. And I don’t think it’s just part of ‘getting older’.

Intellectually and emotionally, I spent large chunks of my thirties coming to terms with the ecological crisis we inherited: trying to grasp the scale of the problem and the [uniqueness](https://twitter.com/EricHolthaus/status/1395554193067413504) of the moment, acknowledging the anxieties it triggers, and turning that discomfort into something manageable and useful. For me, Australia’s recent fires were a particularly traumatic event that provoked lots of mental reorganising.

Despite (or because of) these dark clouds, there is a growing sense of awakening. A feeling that we are – willingly or not – inching closer to the cusp of something new, something different. If you squint hard enough it looks like hope (some call it the Great Turning), although the German in me remains sceptical. As I’m looking ahead to the next decade of being me, I know one thing is certain: the internal remodelling will continue. As Alice Walker writes:

> Those long periods when something inside ourselves seems to be waiting, holding its breath, unsure about what the next step should be, eventually become the periods we wait for, for it is in those periods that we realise that we are being prepared for the next phase of our life and that, in all probability, a new level of the personality is about to be revealed.

Sticking with the theme, to celebrate my 40th I’m kindly asking you to help me offset 40 tons of carbon by planting some trees right here in Australia. Thanks so much! 🎉🌳 – Kai
